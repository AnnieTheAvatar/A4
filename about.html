          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Brighter Future Cat Rescue is a Western Sydney based rescue organisation run by a dedicated family and amazing feline loving foster carers who always put the health and well-being of the rescued cats first.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to rescue, rehabilitate and eventually re-home cats and kittens to a permanent indoor home or alternatively ones with enclosures. This would not only provide a safe and secure loving environment for the cats and kittens but would also minimise the risk of them returning to the streets trying to survive the ever present dangers that come with cats being outside.</p>
          <p>Each cat is provided with a loving foster home where they are socialised and cared for in an environment that we hope mimics their new forever home. During this time, they would receive any vet treatment they require before they are released to their new family.</p>
